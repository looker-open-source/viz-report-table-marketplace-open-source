# Report Table for Looker

A table dedicated to single-page, enterprise summary reports. Useful for PDF
exports, report packs, finance reporting, etc. Does not do multi-page tables and
lists. Does look good for your year-on-year analysis. Originally created by [Jon
Walls](https://github.com/ContrastingSounds/vis-report_table).

![Example Report](docs/marketplace_image.png)

- Quick variance calculations
- Add subtotals (including column subtotals for tables with two levels of pivot)

  - Subtotals taken from Looker subtotals if available, otherwise performed as
    front-end calculation

- Add a header row to non-pivoted tables
- Organise measure columns by pivot value, or by measure

  - Flat tables (i.e. no pivots) can be organised by drag'n'drop

- Transpose (any number of dimensions)
- Easy red/black conditional format
- "Subtotal" format e.g. for highlighting transposed rows of measures
- Themes, including ability to test custom themes using your own css file
- Use LookML tags to give default abbreviations to popular fields
- Reduce to a single dimension value for financial-style reporting
- Drill-to-detail

## Tagging fields in LookML

A common reporting requirement is grouping fields under headings, and
abbreviating column headers when many columns are present. This can be
repetitive work! The Report Table vis will pick up tags in the LookML model,
with the format `"vis-tools:SETTING:VALUE"`.

The current tag settings available are `heading`, `short_name`, `unit`.

    measure: number_of_transactions {
      tags: [
        "vis-tools:heading:Transaction Value",
        "vis-tools:short_name:Volume",
        "vis-tools:unit:#"
      ]
      type: count
      value_format_name: decimal_0
      drill_fields: [transaction_details*]
    }

## Notes

- Maximum of two pivot fields
- Subtotals calculated at the front end are only for simple sums & averages
  - e.g. no Count Distincts, running totals, measures of type "number" with
    arbitrary calculations
  - The vis will use subtotals from the query response if available
  - The tooltip will alert users to "estimated" numbers

## Using Custom CSS

You can also apply your own custom styling by supplying a URL to a CSS file in
the `Load custom CSS from:` option and selecting `Use custom theme` in the
`Theme` tab.

![Theme selector](/docs/custom_theme.png)

In order to serve raw CSS files from your git provider, first pass the URL
through [raw.githack.com](https://raw.githack.com/). Please use [this example
template](/src/theme_custom_template.css) to help you get started with your
customization.

### Interested in extending the visualization for your own use case?

#### Quickstart Dev Instructions

1. **Install Dependecies.**

   Using yarn, install all dependencies

   ```shell
   yarn install
   ```

2. **Make changes to the source code**

3. **Compile your code**

   You need to bundle your code, let's run:

   ```shell
   yarn build
   ```

   If yarn build fails try using:

   ```shell
   bin/build
   ```

4. **Building your code automatically in the background**

   Recommended: Webpack can detect changes and build automatically

   ```shell
   yarn watch
   ```

   Your compiled code can be found in this repo.

5. Running unit tests

   ```shell
   yarn test
   ```

   or

   ```shell
   bin/test
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails with an error code of `ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED`

If you run into the following error when building using `yarn build`:

```shell
Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported ... code: 'ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED'
```

Use the following build command instead:

```shell
env NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider" yarn build
```
